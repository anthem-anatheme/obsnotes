#### Stressors
- Dad “job offer” feels really quite humiliating that neither of my parents think i can get a job by myself, and practically made fun of me applying to them
- Dad talk about “financial plans” that he never seems to have time for
	- I suppose maybe I’m worried about the idea of going to uni and this makes it feel too real in a way?
	- Also dreading having to spend like two hours outside in the insane heat listening to dad going on about this, even though I know it’s literally for my own good and I’m so grateful for it
- Bugs in room and under monitor
#### Look Forward To
- [[Results Day]] feels sooo far away but so close, actually looking forward to seeing how I did, and given that I’m pretty sure I met my offer
- Tennis this Sunday!! So excited to go out and sweat my ass off playing today
- Pig job application, probably gonna be around Monday I hope but I just wanna hear back and get feedback
	- Getting this job would solve stressor #1 and would be a highlight of the summer imo - first job, doing something I’d actually enjoy, on my own and making money
