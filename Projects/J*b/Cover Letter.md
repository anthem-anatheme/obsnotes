Dear Hiring Manager,

As a local resident of Bridge, I often admired the sense of enthusiasm and community The Pig brings to the surrounding area. I am writing to express my interest in the position of Kitchen Porter as I would be proud to be a part of such a vibrant and tight knit community.

In my day to day life, I strive to uphold high standards of organisation and hygiene and am eager to bring this commitment to cleanliness to your establishment. As a student, I held many positions of responsibility working as part of a team and learnt the importance of communication, time management, and attention to detail in a team which I would bring to my role as kitchen porter at The Pig. Through my work experience at St Martin's Hospital, I saw first-hand the importance of teamwork to provide a high standard of service to patients, a quality which is also vital in hospitality, and I would love to contribute to a team to bring this to the patrons of your business.Â 

I also have practical experience in kitchens, helping my relatives to prepare meals and organising and cleaning as they work. Despite the informal nature of this, I learnt the importance of hygiene and cleanliness to keeping a kitchen running smoothly and supporting others, skills that I would bring to the role of Kitchen Porter.

As an avid gardener, I admire the commitment to homegrown produce that brings your meals their own, unique feeling and I am keen to help support this ethos and bring the experience of local, freshly grown food to our customers.

Thank you for considering my application, and I would be happy to further explain how I could help support your team and the high standards of service at The Pig.

Kind Regards,  
Yasir Alhassan
